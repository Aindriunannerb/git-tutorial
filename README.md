# Git Tutorial

This is a test repo for a workshop on Git, forked from an existing project and modified to not use MongoDB.
It contains a Node.js ExpressJS application with a RESTful API.

## Users API

This sample project will give you a minimal users RESTful API to build your contact list template against. It only implements user listing and reading - feel free to add other actions (e.g. update, delete, create) as you see fit. It is built using JavaScript/Node.js (our language of choice), ExpressJS (a small, lightweight web MVC framework) & Mongoose (a MongoDB object modelling library).
